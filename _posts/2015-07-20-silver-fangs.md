i though of that summer\\
my first real summer of nights\\
and I thought of her and her small tits\\
how short she was\\
how black her hair was\\
how blue her eyes were\\
the face she made when she came\\
the sounds she held inside before coming\\
her fucking tight body\\
her perfect teeth, the two canines protruding\\
like a real thing yeah\\
we got close\\
we got warm\\
she was nice to me\\
it was fun for both of us

she loved the paper, how red it was on the side\\
we'd get drunk on zubrowska\\
and fall asleep naked and wet

i stole her book\\
i stutter her name\\
she's out there collecting!

she worked the heartsick yard, probably still does\\
the book was all about that:\\
pull it out mother,\\
see the beating
