they said you would never make it\\
with that wobble in your walk.\\
oh! you call yourself crazy?\\
but I and I know\\
that you cannot spell it.

you get the tired face\\
and your head is low too\\
you wanna go out baby\\
i'm gonna take you out.

okay, check this out:\\
the coin is on the left\\
the flower on the right\\
follow the hand\\
follow the hand

good

you're back inside, you want to go out\\
it's okay\\
look further\\
there is time\\
and there is space\\
there is air\\
there is love
