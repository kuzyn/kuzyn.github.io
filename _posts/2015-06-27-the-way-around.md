right away\\
in the little computer of my mind\\
i write that i am not a drunk and that i am not a gambler\\
then i laugh at myself\\
through the holes in my pockets,\\
from the pit of my stomach, \\
but i am really not.

this is from a man\\
so lost\\
that the only thing he’s looking for\\
is an excuse to explain\\
why he’s so fucked up.

but i go out and see people\\
and they see me and look, there’s music, or a movie\\
or a show or something,\\
but when my head gets hot,\\
when i squeeze my fingers together and press each of them to my thumb,\\
i gotta move and i gotta do i gotta do.

so i am in berlin now.\\
i was in montreal before.\\
i gambled at both casino,\\
got drunk in both country.\\
and what i have learned \\
is that the world moves around me.
