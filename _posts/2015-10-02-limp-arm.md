You talk with friends about waking up in your bed and what feel like
a ghost limb. You bond over your limp arm, waking up with a limp
​ and numb​
arm and how heavy it is and this bond relaxes you and make you belong and
touch outside of yourself and you feel good. The anxiety lifts for a
minute, the tension in your armpits and biceps ease up and you look better,
you feel better.
​ The pressure inside your ears disappears,​
​ l
ife seems less centered around you now. You breath in. The dread is hidden
now, and you do not feel
​that
 if you'd give your
​keys
 to someone so they could go through your stuff
​in case
 something happen to you, you'd die the very next minute. You understand
that you have minimal control over your faith and it
​ feels​
good
​, it gives you more freedom​
​, l
ess responsibilities. You can act without retribution. No fear.

You wake up
​ alone​
in
​ the middle of​
the night with a limp arm a
​n​
d you feel lost and afraid.
