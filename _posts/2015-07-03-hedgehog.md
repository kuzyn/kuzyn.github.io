The punctured clouds let it out, all of it. Billions of relentless,
dropping water pins, like magnetized by the inner core. They reminded him
of a type of weapon, a missile used in Vietnam: a hive of darts that would
be fired from helicopters into the dark and dangerous jungle. The fast thin
metal pricks traversing foliage and tree trunk and hands and lungs and
eyeball, hearts, bugs and birds, lodged forever in the organic.

The rain was slow moving and cold, but just as purposeful. It melded with
him, braids to the monumental ceiling, far, far up there. And for a few
seconds, he didn't know if these were tears or droplets. And for a few more
seconds, he thought of the bodies and souls contained within these heavens,
the same matter in a different arrangement. Were tears different from salty
seas?

He flicked his cigarette streetward. The amber was put out before the butt
hit the ground.
