we both stand on the sidewalk\\
both dressed in black\\
head to toes\\
the jeans and boots\\
both smoking a cigarette\\
we both have green eyes

and she says:\\
"your anxiety is like a soap in your hand\\
]your dread is like the rain in the world\\
your sadness, your formidable sadness\\
is vain\\
and is like mine, is like all sadness.\\
oh, don't you know my friend\\
your anxiety is like a soap"

tight hands\\
by the bar\\
there's raindrops and then there's storms
