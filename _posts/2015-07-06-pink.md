he was thinking about writing: the teacher\\
but the keyboard keys didn't work and he got so mad so fast\\
that he slammed the blade of his palm on the keyboard

he though "i didn't see this coming"\\
the screen was clustered pink and he felt guilt, embarrassment, dread\\
he saw the kid in him, the kid that would be calm until the limit of being
calm\\
then would punch a hole in the wall or leave teeth marks in plastic\\
over a slow-loading website\\
or a laggy videogame\\
he hoped the computer would boot again, he prayed and pleaded.

these are the times, these are the words he thought:\\
don't shy away from them

he remembered the teacher in class, composed and cold\\
always one step ahead\\
not out of cleverness but pure wits it seemed\\
such a sharp mind\\
then he'd see a man faint in his class and the teacher turned into a
puddle\\
ran out of the class\\
headclutching ohmygod\\
back in class, freaking out, leaving\\
the guy had a sugar drop or something,\\
he was okay\\
but that teacher, that man,\\
was sharp enough to cut himself.

and there is this time, just before leaving,\\
he saw him again\\
off the hours, civilian to civilian\\
him with friends, the teachers with his lover\\
so giggly, so alloverher kidlike\\
what was that about?\\
aren't you supposed to be a genius?\\
how do geniuses do that?\\
how do geniuses go ski in switzerland?

they just switch it off or something\\
screw in the moment, talk in the present

this man is not a genius because a genius is like a rock and you can't get
anything out of the rock because you don't speak rock language.

you stare,\\
the rock stares back.

you close your eyes\\
the rock doesn't because it doesn't have eyes

your eyelids are pink.
