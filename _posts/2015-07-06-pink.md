he was thinking about writing: the teacher\\
but the keyboard keys didn't work and he got so mad so fast\\
that he slammed the blade of his palm on the keyboard

he though "i didn't see this coming"\\
the screen was clustered pink and he felt guilty and embarrassed, \\
he saw the kid in him, the kid that would be calm until the limit of being
calm\\
then would punch a hole in the wall or leave teeth marks in plastic\\
over a slow-loading website\\
or a laggy videogame\\
he hoped the computer would boot again, he prayed and pleaded.

these are the times, these are the words he thought:\\
don't shy away from them.

he remembered the teacher in class, composed and cold\\
always one step ahead\\
pure wits\\
and such a sharp mind\\
completely\\
self\\
aware

then the teacher saw a man faint in his class and he turned into a
puddle\\
ran out of the class\\
headclutching ohmygod\\
back in class, freaking out, leaving again\\
(the guy had a sugar drop or something,\\
he was okay\\
but that teacher, that man,\\
was sharp enough to cut himself)

and there is this time, just before leaving,\\
he saw him again\\
off the hours, guys in the street\\
him with friends, the teacher with his lover\\
so giggly, so alloverher kidlike\\
what was that about?\\
aren't you supposed to be a genius?\\
how do geniuses do that?\\
how do geniuses go ski in switzerland?\\
how do they wash dishes?

they switch it off?

then i understood something:

this man is not a genius because a genius is like a rock and you can't get
anything out of the rock because you don't speak mineral

you try to get the rock's secret;\\
the rock does not mind

you stare;\\
you identify with the rock so you think that it stares back

you close your eyes;\\
the rock doesn't because it doesn't have eyes

you notice that your eyelids are pink.
