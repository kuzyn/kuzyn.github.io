his lips were cut like a bad fish mouth he, he had tattoos, he, he had some
sort of leather getup\\
i was walking the streets, i was looking looking\\
when i flicked my cigarette, i trailed the red tip with my eyes\\
then my look bent, then i saw the gun\\
it was an automatic thing, fully automatic like a robot and me, me and
fishmouth got to running,\\
wondering what we could do with, with a magazine full of bullet in an
automatic machine gun;

in the alley, in there we looked at each other and at the gun\\
and if it was a damp night, there was halos of fog around neons,\\
the gun was beautiful;

they say there's only one reason to ever use a gun, right?

we followed the truck, and we stayed behind\\
they were loading up money from all of the banks into the truck;

the money kept rolling and me and fishmouth kept rolling with it\\
i was flicking the safety on and off and on and off and just feeling the
weight of the automatic machine gun in my hand and its temperature and how
it communicate all of its metal thoughts and guts when i am turning the\\
safety on when i'm turning the safety off, when i'm ready to use it when i
want to use it;

fishmouth kept driving and the the truck was a stop at, oh about two
hundred feet from us

i could not easily remember where i had gotten the gun, why i was there,
what is it that i was doing, what i was about to do

there is only one way to use a gun, right?

your fingers shake,\\
touch the buzz

your teeth clatter,\\
taste the buzz

just imagine your brain on the trigger,\\
just imagine the buzz

i said outloud "you can get the dishes out but no one will be eating here
anymore" then i made their faces explode and their brains show and fishgut
took the money and we left and we never felt bad about it because the gun
was there and the money was there too. and oh baby, i don't feel bad about
it, is it wrong?
