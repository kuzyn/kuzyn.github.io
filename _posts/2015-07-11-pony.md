she said​​\\

"I felt like a pony,\\

a very tired pony."


And I almost burst into tears. My stomach sank in love and lost, completely
lost in front of someone that I did not understand but loved like a ghost, like
a ghost haunts, like a ghost loves a house. I did not understand why she
came, why it was so hot, why we sat on garbage bags full of clothes.


A bite. A scar. A tattoo. I said I wanted a pentagram instead of a pentagon.
 I wanted her mark like a curse.


Darling\\

you owe me,\\

I owe you too.

When she said she had to go I said "yeah" and I understood that part very
well, the part where she would not stay. I opened the door and she walked
out and I think I let her go a bit and walked up to her, and kissed her
like you kiss a velvet rope that is wrapped around your head.

Maybe I kissed nothing and let her walk away and wished I would have kiss
the velvet rope, I can't remember.

It was still life,\\
it was the airport's jetty\\
before I got shot.

No need for a mark when the mark's inside and the curse's inside too and
you go on reliving that moment like a ghost trying to live again, but who
dies twice in the end.

Saw your picture today, you are beautiful. It has been so long, years. I
had forgot how beautiful you are. I knew but had forgotten.

Oh baby,\\
I miss you,\\
miss me too.
