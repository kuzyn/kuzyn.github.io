draw draw drawl\\
but i'm not going

just wetting my lips before critique\\
and i feel numb like cheeks in snow,\\
inside-out

naive promises were made,\\
does it matter what my friend said?

i stare and smile,\\
faith motives:\\
i lived with a woman so tight\\
that even in sleep i could not dream\\

i ask questions when no one's looking
