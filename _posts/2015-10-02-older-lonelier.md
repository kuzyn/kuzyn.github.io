those years where instead of taking trash out,\\
you bring it in

we laughed at the tattoos\\
then we got the tattoos

we laughed at the piercings\\
then we got the piercing

we laughed at the goatees\\
but then\\
we'll get the goatees

last night i dreamed of a winning scratch ticket\\
the prize was polaris

i find that beautiful

but i don't know what it means.
