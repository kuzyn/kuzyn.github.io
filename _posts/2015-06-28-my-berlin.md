your jacket on the floor\\
where the cigarettes are\\
after a long drunk walk\\
and it is almost a perfect day\\
back to the studio\\
back to the synagogue's wall

what's looking out for you out here?\\
the cobbles, the sun\\
pictures and\\
a\\
tiny\\
little\\
clock.

your bottle is in the fridge,\\
set it down, there's a sign:\\
it'll pop the commonwealth right out of you

look up and say to me:

"in my daze\\
and in my dream\\
this place here\\
this is my berlin"
