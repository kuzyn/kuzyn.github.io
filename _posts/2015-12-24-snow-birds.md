i shovel and shovel  
there is more snow than air, it's a blizzard  
i shovel more snow than i could ever shovel as a kid and i look right past
it,  
into to far grey and black and late wind  
and i don't see nothing  
but i know that the mountains are there  
i know that they are big and kinda there forever

everything is white

and i hear a crow

i shovel and shovel  
i don't shovel the snow, i shovel myself  
there is no need to shovel, have you ever shoveled in a blizzard?  
they say don't bother you'll have to do it again  
they don't get it.  
i don't do it for the snow  
i do it for myself  
the snow will be there well after  
i am done being happy about having snow to shovel.

i think about the crow

i think of a bird in a blizzard

we all know winter
