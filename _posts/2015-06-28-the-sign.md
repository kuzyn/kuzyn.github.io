i remember him mad in his car\\
and he ranted, looking straight ahead to my cascading laughter\\
and the story went\\
that while he was running on the mountain,\\
he looked down\\
and saw in the mud\\
two sticks of gums forming an x.\\
he looked to the side and heard the moaning and saw the invitation\\
for some outdoor fucking.\\
the sign, the pieces of gum were the sign.

and he was not mad that there was outdoor fucking,\\
but rather that he was collared like a rabbit on the mountain;\\
he was mad\\
that it happened enough time\\
for him to decipher the sign\\
and explain it to me.

i thought it was quite a funny, wondered if the gum brand mattered\\
or if the gum sticks were wrapped in foil\\
or if the gum was used\\
after the outdoor fucking.
